# Censorship-Resistance Survey and new MEV games

Multiple Concurrent Proposers has been a huge topic of discussion over the last weeks among the community. However, no survey and unified literature has been found of all the Censorship-Resistance protocols and analysis between them, as new type of games that can be played in the MCP setting.

## Background and Problem Statement

Censorship resistance is a significant challenge facing the Ethereum community, primarily due to the monopolistic tendencies inherent in leader-based consensus mechanisms. Initially, various protocols, such as Inclusion Lists, were proposed to address this issue. However, newer protocols, such as FOCIL and BRAID, have recently emerged. Despite their potential, no comprehensive comparative studies have been conducted to analyze these protocols or to explore the new dynamics they introduce in the proposers vs. proposers scenario. Additionally, potential strategies for mitigating these emerging challenges have yet to be thoroughly examined.

## Plan and Deliverables

The survey is currently being written and studying the state of the art. The roadmap would be as follows:

- Current structure of the survey and discuss improvements with Flashbots researchers
- Provide a paper, arxiv link with the survey with zero background to engage more people in the research in censorship-resistance
