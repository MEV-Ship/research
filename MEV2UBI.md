# Redistributing MEV as Universal Basic Income: Design and Implementation of the MEV2UBI system

## Abstract

This project proposes an approach to repurpose the impact of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem by designing a redistribution mechanism that supports tokenized universal basic income (UBI) and liquidity provisioning for solving gridlocks in economic credit networks. UBI is intended as a periodic payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement. Credit networks are exchange systems used to settle and offset debt among people in a network. We will design, validate and implement MEV2UBI, a smart contract based redistribution mechanism, which will enforce validators to redistribute part of the MEV as UBI in the form of a DAO. A Proof-of-Concept compatible with the Ethereum blockchain will be developed and proposed as a tool for incentivising Flashbots validators. 

## Background

Decentralized Finance (DeFi), built on blockchain technologies, attempts to replace traditional financial intermediaries with decentralized applications (DApps) for peer-to-peer transactions, lending, and borrowing (Zhang and Jacobsen, 2018; Schär, 2021). 
However, the experience of the production of blocks within a blockchain shows that Maximum Extractable Value undermines the decentralization of blockchain ecosystems (Bartoletti and Zunnino, 2022), as it allows privileged actors to unduly extract value from the blockchain operation by virtue of their position as an asset owning class
Such phenomenon manifests in the political economy of blockchains when participants with the ordering power (i.e. block proposer, which can be validators, or miners in Proof-of-Work contexts), deliberately manipulate the order of transactions or select specific transactions to maximize their own profit.

Recent research efforts allow us to model and quantify the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and its composition (Salles, 2021) in blockchain-based systems. Empirical measurements indicate that Ethereum is frequently a target of market manipulations, with techniques including frontruns and backruns (Flashbots, 2020) resulting in substantial implications for both individual users and the blockchain network (Flashbots, 2020). Several approaches to mitigate MEV-related issues have been advanced. The Cow (Coincidence of Wants)1 protocol, for instance, searches and matches for inverse trades (i.e. the coincidences of wants). This reduces the arbitrage opportunity window for external actors to perform MEV extraction. Other solutions, by contrast, such as the MEV-share protocol by Flashbots, address the problem from a different angle. Rather than focusing on reducing the arbitrage opportunity window, the MEV-Share protocol allows all involved stakeholders to benefit from the potential profits arising from transaction reordering operation. In this protocol users directly submit these transactions to the MEV-Share Node, which segregates user transactions from the general mempool, thus reducing exposure to adversarial actors. The MEV-Share Node also notifies searchers about user transactions, so that they can create strategically bundled transactions, designed to extract MEV. Each bundle includes a payment, calculated based on the anticipated profit from successfully executing the contained transactions. These bundles are communicated directly to block proposers, who, then, form blocks with such transaction sets, prioritizing the most lucrative. Once a bundle is successfully integrated into a block, the searcher realizes the profit. Part of the profit is redistributed to the original transacting parties.

## Problem Statement

The efforts outlined above are crucial to maintain the credibility of major permissionless Ethereum networks, and increasingly impact control over blockchain networks, which existing studies confirm to have become increasingly centralized. For instance, empirical studies (Kusmierz and Overko 2021; Zhao et al., 2022) indicate a concentration of tokenized assets, including cryptocurrencies and governance tokens, in a few hands. This is likely due to the plutocratic governance encoded logic of one token one vote, which only exacerbates asset/power differentials within the network given how block production in Ethereum is currently structured.

Externally, Ethereum is experiencing a growing trend of compliance with regulatory frameworks, such as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions in the case of Ethereum. Over 73% of Ethereum's daily blocks have been found to enforce OFAC compliance, marking a steep increase from previous figures and adding to the community's growing censorship concerns​. This trend towards regulatory alignment, while potentially enhancing legitimacy and mainstream acceptance, raises concerns about the dilution of core blockchain principles like decentralization and censorship resistance. 

Our project aims to address the centralization of power in blockchain networks, focusing on the Ethereum network as a case study. We highlight one major gap in literature. 

There is a lack of redistribution mechanisms aiming to enhance the equity of blockchain ecosystems and their use value to the real world economy. In particular, while existing protocols redistribute MEV to participants in the MEV supply chain, the redistribution doesn’t impact the larger user base nor do they incentivise the use of Ethereum infrastructure in local economies. Given the inevitability of MEV within the current blockchain political economy, we aim to adopt a model that takes the structure of MEV as a starting point in order to find ways of redistributing value. We propose a series of redistributive policies to reduce power imbalances in blockchain networks. We call this approach MEV2UBI or MEV2Cycles.

To pursue this goal, we address one main research question and related sub-research questions.


* **RQ1**: What is the design of the MEV2UBI smart system?
* **RQ2**: What is the token economy design of the system enabling the redistribution of the MEV as UBI?
* **RQ3**: What architectural components and interfaces support the MEV-UBI redistribution system?
* **RQ4**: what is the EMV-compatible implementation of the system enabling the redistribution of the MEV2UBI?

## Research Plan and Deliverables

The project will develop in eight months, and be divided into two phases, each of 4 months.  By virtue of the synergy with diverse research groups, such as the Fribis NetFi research group, the Hermes Lab, the Bitspossessed developer collective and researchers from the Circles UBI team, the researchers hired with the funds granted will collaborate with computer scientists, smart contract developers and other researchers.Furthermore, this project will contribute to the running case of a PhD thesis in computer science on extending and evaluating T-DM method, whose defense is foreseen by the beginning of 2025 (Avanzo et al., 2023).

### Phase 1 (M1-M4): 

The research phase will respond to the RQ 1 and RQ 2 and provide the following contributions.  

In order to respond to RQ1 and RQ2, we delve into the platform-independent design of the MEV2UBI DApp. This involves outlining the system's core functionalities by virtue of a state-of-the-art software engineering methodology for DApp development. This supports modeling of token economies and governance processes, essential to our scope. The method adopted, based on model-driven development, will also speed up the concrete implementation of the system, as it will support smart contract code generation from abstract models. This method will be applied by a PhD student from the University of Torino, who developed an extension of the T-DM described in the citation (Avanzo et al., 2023). The MEV2UBI running case will contribute to the evaluation of the modeling language and tool support developed, relevant to his thesis.

T-DM extends traditional UML syntax  in order to take into account the main concepts of DApps and address the complexity, usability and scalability issues common to all DApps (Udokwu et al., 2020). In addressing RQ2, we map requirement models of the extended version of T-DM to Static Architecture and Behavioral diagrams, which extend UML component and sequence diagrams respectively. This will cast light on the architectural components and interfaces that will serve to implement the system, aiming to efficiently manage the extraction, pooling and redistribution of MEV to users. 

### Phase 2 (M4-M8): 

In order to answer RQ3 and RQ4, in this phase we will implement the CirclesUBI smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet and develop a DAO for CirclesUBI based on the models in phase 1. CircesUBI is a Universal Basic Income project launched on Gnosis chain in October 2020. CirclesUBI is powered by Web of Trust (WoT) infrastructure, where people make trust relationships with each other in order to establish credit circles. Each account has their own Circles token (CRC) and is created at a rate of 1 CRC per minute which can be exchanged directly with other trusted accounts. CirclesUBI teams have established pilots in Berlin and Bali in order to test and improve the system within diverse regional economies. The aim of the Circles DAO will be to distribute MEV2UBI via a Flashbots validator. 

The deliverable of phase 2 will be to have a set of smart contracts that can be used by the Flashbots validator to decide where and how to distribute value via the Circles web of trust. For example, through MEV, the Flashbots validators can incentivise the creation of business credit networks using Circles to settle obligations. Validators can choose to either directly give MEV to individual members of the network or collectively for liquidity provisioning for solving gridlocks in economic credit networks.

## Conclusion

Our research investigates the impact of a solution redistributing MEV as UBI to different Ethereum network users. We focus on design and implementation of smart contracts implementing the MEV2UBI redistribution protocol. State-of-the-art software engineering methods will be adopted. In particular, we adopt an extension of the Trust Dapp Modelling (T-DM) software engineering method to model the system requirements in terms of token economy design and governance, its architecture and validate its behavior. The implementation of the MEV2UBI DApp aims to improve economic dynamism within the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing for a wider variety of use cases. As a result of the distribution, this research has significant implications for blockchain governance models. The MEV2UBI mechanism aims to exemplify how blockchain technology can be harnessed for social good, particularly in the realm of economic redistribution as UBI and within different types of credit clearing, mutual and mesh credit networks.
